# Image-detection
Image Detection Application using Transfer Learning with VGG19 model, Tensorflow and FastAPI.

Creation of an application to perform an image classification. I use CIFAR 10 dataset from Tensorflow with 10 images to classify ("Airplane","Automobile", "Bird", "Cat", "Deer", "Dog", "Frog", "Horse", "Ship", "Truck"). For the transfer learning model, I used VGG19 model. For the Backend, I used FastAPI and Tensorflow for the modelling part.

# Prediction example
Here is an example with a horse image.

## Home Page
<img src = "screenshots app/input.png" width = "600">

## Image to classify
<img src ="screenshots app/my_image.jpg" width = "600">

## Result of the prediction
<img src = "screenshots app/output.png" width = "600">
